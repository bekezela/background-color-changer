# background-color-changer

This project was inspired by ICODETHIS.

The HTML & CSS code was provided.

Implement the following functionalities:

Clicking on the “Change” button should generate a random background color for the entire <body>
The RGB value of the randomly generated color should be shown below the “Change” button, instead of the current rgb(255, 255, 255) value
