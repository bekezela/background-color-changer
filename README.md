This project was inspired by ICODETHIS
HTML & CSS code was provided.

Implement the following functionalities:
clicking on the “Change” button should generate a random background color for the entire <body>
the RGB value of the randomly generated color should be shown below the “Change” button, instead of the current rgb(255, 255, 255) value
